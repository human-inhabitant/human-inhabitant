#### Some details...
I am a web troller :trollface:... code tinkerer :hammer:... Tor patron :lock:... and a self taught full-stack developer, I have been trolling/developing since the year... `2e3`.

*Remember [Classic ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) with [Microsoft Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access) backends...?* I do.  
*Remember [framesets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset) and using [tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for layout...?* Yep, me too.  
*Remember the whole [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) push and fail...?* That's right, me too.

My current position includes `Java`, `Groovy`, `JavaScript`, *old* `AngularJS`, `Jest`, `MSSQL` and `MySQL`, all things [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) and thousands of lines of legacy spaghettification (that they are trying to fix overnight).

```javascript
const fact = ( later === never );
```

#### Some <abbr title="Too much information...">TMI</abbr>...
My primary joys these days are God (theology), my lovely :woman: Patti, :dog2: Muffin, `JavaScript` ([ES5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition), [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2015)-isms), `PHP` and Metal Bass (the :guitar: not the :fish:), in that order...  actually.

I am a privacy advocate :closed_lock_with_key: and have *de-Googled* myself entirely with only one current road block. My phone... still waiting on [/e/](https://e.foundation/) to sell to the US then it will be official.
