#### Some details...
I am a self taught full-stack developer, I have been developing since the year... 2e3.

Remember Classic ASP with Microsoft Access backends...? I do.  
Remember framesets and tables for layout...? Yep, me too.  
Remember the whole XHTML push and fail...? That's right, me too.

My current position includes Java, Groovy, JavaScript, *old* AngularJS, Jest, MSSQL and MySQL, all things [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) and thousands of lines of legacy spaghettification (that they are trying to fix overnight).

My primary joys these days are God (theology), :woman: Patti, :dog2: Muffin, JavaScript (ES5, ES6-isms), PHP and Metal Bass (the :guitar: not the :fish:), in that order. 

I am a privacy advocate and have *de-Googled* myself entirely with only one current road block. My phone... still waiting on [/e/](https://e.foundation/) to sell to the US then it will be official.
