#### Some details...

I am a web troller... code tinkerer... Tor patron... and a self taught full-stack developer, I have been trolling/developing since the year... `2e3`.

*Remember [Classic ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) with [Microsoft Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access) backends...?* I do.  
*Remember [framesets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset) and using [tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for layout...?* Yep, me too.  
*Remember the whole [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) push and fail...?* That's right, me too.

My current position includes `Java`, `Groovy`, `JavaScript`, *old* `AngularJS`, `Jest`, `MSSQL` and `MySQL`, all things [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) and thousands of lines of legacy spaghettification (that they are trying to fix overnight).

#### Some TMI...
My primary joys these days are God (theology), my lovely :woman: Patti, :dog2: Muffin, `linux`, `JavaScript` ([ES5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition), [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2015)-isms), `PHP` and Metal Bass (the :guitar: not the :fish:), in that order...  actually.

I am a :closed_lock_with_key: privacy advocate and have *de-Googled* myself entirely with only one current road block. My phone... still waiting on [/e/](https://e.foundation/) to sell to the US then it will be official.

Some alternatives (:star: faves):  
* Email/Calendar
   * [Tutanota](https://www.tutanota.com/) :star:  
     My main email provider, via my own domain. Super easy to use and has decent mobile/desktop apps.
   * [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) :star:  
     Also super easy to use and also has a decent mobile app. Though, I use Tutanota as a primary email source, ProtonMail's UI, to me, is far superior...
   * [StartMail](https://www.startmail.com/)  
     Have been with them for years... but still no mobile app and no calendar. Kind of a back burner email provider for me now.
   * [Posteo](https://posteo.de/)  
     Was fun originally, with all the green hype, but a touch overkill for an email service as it based on [Roundcube](https://roundcube.net/), affordable, but this too has no mobile app. I am just letting my euro's run out at this point.
* Search
   * [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) :star:  
     I stopped using Google search years ago... I don't even [!g](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=!g) anything. The browser extension must be really good, as my companies corporate policy forces me to remove it *(there is **NO** privacy in a corporate environment, don't let them tell you otherwise)*.
   * [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com/)  
     I like them, the premise seems sound but... they [pay Google](https://startpage.com/#home__section__tech), so not really a *de-Googling* venture for me.
* Chat & Messaging
   * [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) :star:  
     My current default messaging app, even have the wife using it. The PIN thing was bloody obnoxious!
   * [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)  
     Love the idea of Keybase, I just don't know enough encryption minded people to take full advantage of it... *(sighs)*.
* File Sync & Sharing
   * [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/) :star:  
     I use this on multiple platforms BUT... crazy expensive.
   * [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)  
     Again, love the idea of Keybase, I just don't know enough encryption minded people to take full advantage of it... *(continues to sigh)*.
* Notes
   * [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) :star:  
     An end-to-end encrypted note-taking app.
   * [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)  
     Keybase can store your photos, videos, and documents with end-to-end encryption.
* Browsers
   * [Brave](https://brave.com/) :star:  
     The whole [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) thing is a bit wonky, but blocks adds like no ones business.
   * [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)  
     Meh... better than Chrome.
   * [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)  
     For the super paranoid... those who disable JavaScript.
* Passwords
   * [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) :star:  
     I am currently using Bitwarden, but I am always leary of any cloud based product. Open source or not...
   * [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)  
     A bit of a nuisance on multiple platforms, syncing sucks.
* Phone
   * [/e/](https://e.foundation)  
     Lots of hype... but they dislike Americans, you got to be `adb` savy to enjoy one of these in the US.
* VPN *(note log-less VPN's are a myth)*
   * [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) :star:  
     Best bang for your buck, easy to install on Linux and Windblows... I always run with VPN killswitch engaged. I do run into multiple sites that block me though. PIA stopped accepting blocked IP reports, so I either find another compatible site or if desperate disable the VPN.
   * [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)  
     Not to bad, though set up on Linux is not for the faint of heart, often fails an [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/) test.
